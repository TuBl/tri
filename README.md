# What is this repo?

This is my first golang project, trying to learn the language while also building something that is somewhat useful in my day-to-day workflow, I spend a lot of time in the terminal and 
I always wanted to build CLI applications but bash was less than appealing and even though I found it super easy to build them using Laravel commands, I heard a lot of good things about Go,
Cobra and decided to give it a go, following this [tutorial](https://spf13.com/presentation/building-an-awesome-cli-app-in-go-oscon/) from the go docs.

## Next steps

I would like to expand on the basic functionality by including search & edit capabilities hoping to get this app to a state where I can srsly use it instead of always jotting down quick notes
/ todos on my raycast sticky notes.
